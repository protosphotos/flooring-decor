<p>Prefinished wood floors are durable and have a water-resistant finish but may not be the best choice for moist areas like the bathroom. Prefinished just means the finish is already applied and does not need to be finished on site. You can test if the finish layer is still intact by dropping a small amount of water on it and waiting to see if the water beads up or is absorbed into the wood. While prefinished hardwood is resistant to scuffs and dents its just as vulnerable to water damage as any other hardwood floor.</p>

<p>Much like a tile or linoleum floor Ipe hardwood is very easy to clean. I would not recommend pre finished hardwood especially for such an area because you dont have finish over the entire floor surface. Prefinished hardwood flooring is more expensive than unfinished hardwood flooring. Its composite plywood core has been constructed to be more stable than its organic solid counterpart making it less likely to buckle ripple and warp when wet. If you live in a humid climate or are installing wood in a room prone to spills such as a kitchen or a bathroom then engineered prefinished hardwood is the best option.</p>
