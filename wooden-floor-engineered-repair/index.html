<p>Engineered wood flooring is made to look just like solid wood flooring but on more affordable price and it comes even more durably and damage resistant. For a larger or deeper area of wood or engineered wood floor damage we try a color-matched floor putty or a wax-based flooring repair kit. Our professionally trained Surface Repair Technicians repair Timber Floors Engineered and Vinyl Flooring cost effectively without the need for re-sanding and ripping up boards. With solid hardwood floors you can sand and scrape away up to a quarter of an inch off the wood to remove water damage on the surface.
