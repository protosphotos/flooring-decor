<p>The larger the room the more space will be needed in the case of expanding hardwood. If the issue is the former quickly sliding the floorboards to eliminate the expansion gap may fix it.

<p>In most cases the perimeter expansion gap is related to the thickness of the new flooring. The moisture caused by a wet basement is enough to significantly swell and buckle the hardwood floor above it so ignore the expansion gap rule at your.

Wood flooring in high water areas really boils down to dedication in keeping the floor dry. Pin On Renovation.</p>
