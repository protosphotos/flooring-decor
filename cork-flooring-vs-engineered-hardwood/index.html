<p>Engineered hardwood flooring is usually a more budget-friendly option but does not last as long as solid hardwood flooring. Engineered Hardwood is available with various features such as Installable Over Cork Underlayment Prefinished Underlayment Required and Stainable. Widths can range between 5 to 12-inches in most cases and the thickness varies considerably as well. Engineered wood would be a good option for you.
