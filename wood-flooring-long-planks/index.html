<p><strong>Wood Flooring Long Planks</strong>, There is a simplicity to this style of wood flooring that is as satisfying as it is aesthetically pleasing and few styles can show off the natural characteristics of the wood quite as well as long plank flooring. In keeping with original flooring traditions we customise longer wider planks so as to reduce the the number of end edge joints in the floor creating a more calming welcoming visual environment. So whereas you might spend between 3 and 12 for regular solid hardwood per square foot you can expect to pay closer to 413 per square foot for wider planks. Keep Distance Between Seams.</p>
