<p>I-Joists have what is called span charts that can be utilized by the carpenters to allow for a variety of job site modifications. They save me a lot of time on installation and make a much better floor system IMHO. Most I-joists also come with knockouts to run plumbing and wires through to save time on drilling. However if a deeper joist is used on a bigger span the joist price will reduce against a shallow depth as the depth allows the joist to work with smaller timbers and less metal webs.

<p>Using engineered wood flooring If the engineered wood flooring planks are at least 18mm thick they can be secret nailed or secret screwed directly onto the existing wooden floor boards. They help to stabilize the floor better than if you were just to use a 2 x 10 or some other sort of joist support. These characteristics make it much safer to use I-joists over long spans on your floor and in roof structures.
