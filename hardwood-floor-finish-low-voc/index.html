<p>There has long been a concern that low-VOC water-based products dont perform as well as those made with petroleum bases and chemical solvents. These regulations vary from state-to-state and can be as high as 550gL and as low as 275gL. There are no exempt VOCs or solvents. I used Hemp Oil on my floors a purest option.

<p>Finishing a floor in the home will create large quantities of VOCs while the stain and finish cure. A finish will off-gas volatile organic compounds while it is applied to the engineered hardwood floor dried and cured. While you can decrease your exposure to toxins by focusing on ventilation its always a good idea to buy low-VOC flooring products too. Just Floored LLC is proud to offer low VOC and No VOCs wood floor products that have lower or no formaldehyde for a better healthy environment.
