<p>Prefinished hardwood flooring is treated at the factory with a very durable UV-cured urethane sealant embedded with aluminum oxide crystals. I also use the recommended cleaner from the floor installer. It provides an eternal beauty that can be a valued asset to any kitchen or home. If more stability is needed because of the geographical location of the house and the tendency of the humidity to fluctuate engineered wood is probably your best bet to avoid cupping and gapping.

<p>It provides an eternal beauty that can be a valued asset to any kitchen or home. Kitchens Baths Beyond offers a large inventory of prefinished solid and engineered wood flooring and luxury vinyl tile. Hardwood flooring can be bought prefinished or it can be finished on-site as part of the installation. The protective coating created by this process is much more durable than anything that can be applied on-site and can last up.
