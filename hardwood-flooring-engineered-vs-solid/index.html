<p>Engineered hardwood is more forgiving with moisture as its more stable. Because it is solid all the way through solid hardwood flooring can be sanded and refinished several times giving a new lease of life each time and therefore a longer lifespan. If you have a tight budget for your floor then engineered hardwood usually works out more cost effective than solid. But the most critical factor to deciding between solid or engineered is the type of home you live in where your home is located and your preferences as to the performance of your floor from season to season. Expect a solid hardwood floor to give you anywhere between 80 to 100 years service compared to around 50 years for a well-looked-after engineered floor.</p>
