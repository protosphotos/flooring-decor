<p>Solid wood all natural real wood and solid hardwood. Consider the Usage Hardwood may not be the best flooring choice in a heavily used bathroom where children will splash around but it can be perfect in a guest bath or powder room that contains only a vanity and where theres little chance of water puddling on the floor.

<p>Of all hardwood flooring options engineered is a better choice for a bathroom than solid as plywood or solid wood bottom layers hold up against moisture relatively well and are very dimensionally stable. Hardwood is a better bathroom flooring choice than say carpet but it can still be very problematic. As Ron said above - water issues. In this connection it can be installed in damp basements or spaces which have either higher humidity or lower humidity than normal levels.

<p>Its just important to note that more care will be needed then say that of laminate. Theres no need to favour naturally rot-resistant species for indoor applications involving higher-than-normal moisture levels. An engineered hardwood floor could hold up well in spacious. Engineered hardwood flooring is dimensionally stable and therefore does not fluctuate too much in response to humidity so its generally best to go with engineered floors instead of solid wood.
