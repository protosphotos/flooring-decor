<p>Floating floors have greater space between the planks which allows for expansion and contraction as the weather changes. A hardwood floor in a floating install is inherently quieter than a laminate floor in the same setting. I have recently purchased high quality engineered hardwood flooring for a few rooms in my house. Floating floors are a more economical and affordable engineered hardwood flooring option.

<p>Engineered hardwood floors can be glued or nailed into position but they also have the option of being floated over an underlay. If you choose to fix your hardwood floor into position you then have the choice of either gluing your floor to the subfloor using flexible flooring adhesive to create a full. The adhesive approach is generally used when installing over concrete. The installation process of floating type wood flooring is less price than the glue type wood flooring.
