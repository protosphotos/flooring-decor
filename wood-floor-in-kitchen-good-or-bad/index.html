<p>Something like a burst pipe can cause terrible damage if not discovered so be on the look out. Hardwood Floors are warmer on your feet. This is perhaps the most egregious myth associated with wood floors as wood floors such as those from Nydree are 300 more durable and scratch- and dent-resistant than other wood flooring. A hardwood floor is also generally softer than tile meaning that should you accidentally drop breakable items there is a chance they will survive the fall rather than shatter.
