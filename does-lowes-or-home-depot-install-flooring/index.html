<p>This means that you have no way of knowing in advance who is going to install your carpet until they show up at your door with your new carpet or flooring. I dont know why so many contractors shop there. Log in or sign up to reply. People also ask does Lowes do free installation.

<p>I personally wouldnt use any of them for doing an installation. The basic installation price from either of these two box stores is around 380. How much does Lowes charge for laminate floor installation. Then I went online and saw that ArtWalk Tile has Marca Corona Easywood for 317sqft.

<p>I would not use them for flooring or tile work. The stores are getting paid more than the actual installer for doing absolutely nothing. Both Lowes and Home Depot have been trying to lure-in unsuspecting homeowners for years by offering low-cost or free basic carpet installation. Because we are a nationwide buying group with over 100 of us across the country we buy directly from the manufacturers and get good rates usually we are buying it at the same rates as Home Depot.
