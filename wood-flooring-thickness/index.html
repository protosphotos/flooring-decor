<p><strong>Wood Flooring Thickness</strong>, The 516-inch thick is a thinner version of the 34-inch hardwood floor. Since its solid you cant install it in the basement or on concrete below ground level but its thin enough to glue down to concrete at ground level or install over plywood at or above ground level. For joist spacing of more than 16 inches up to 192 inches on center the minimum thickness for both plywood and OSB is 34 inch. Both however are durable and will rarely need refinishing particularly pre-finished engineered wood floors which hold up well against moist conditions too.</p>
