<p>All of the thownhouses around here are the same and all have the wood floors. Its great at tackling those hard-to-reach areas like armrests and curtains and its perfect for cleaning the inside of the car too. We just moved to a new townhouse. With so many styles and brands available both hardwood flooring and carpet come with a broad price range.
