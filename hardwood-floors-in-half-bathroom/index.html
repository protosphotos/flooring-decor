<p>Many homes have bathrooms with wood floors. But thats probably because we are empty nesters living in a dry climate where the floors are not exposed to continuous moisture. Besides they are also a beneficial and highly trafficked room for anybody in. You can test if the finish layer is still intact by dropping a small amount of water on it and waiting to see if the water beads up or is absorbed into the wood.

Installing hardwood in half bathrooms is an excellent choice that will create a warm and inviting feature and perform just as well as in other rooms throughout the home. I have a half bath off of my foyer that I was going to put hardwood in as well since it would flow very nicely.
